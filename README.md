# Music Releases

It's a  website that features the latest music releases and show artist profiles. Artist and album names are clickable and will link you to the their respective URL.

### The Problem

This is the first time we work on React.js. During the project, we had a deeper understanding of relationship between parent comp and child comp. We struggled with prop and key. We read materials for learning the concept. Also searched similar quesions and posted quesions on stack over flow. It was very helpful and saved out time. We also used google and chatGPT to search how to write the hover, especially to change the icons' color. CSS and responsive design were quite challenge this week. 
We made the sidebar works, however we didn't have enough time to make the layout look better, so we had to delete.
